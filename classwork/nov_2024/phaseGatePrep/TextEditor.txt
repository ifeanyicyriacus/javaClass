menue option:
1. add
2. view
3. delete
4. quit

create an array variable to hold the user list items
add should use the current index and the .append() method
view sould use a loop to display the list item (up to array.lenght)
delete case should also show you the list like view:
	once you enter the a value it deleted the value from array (i think pop())
	
quit sends the sentinel value to the while loop
