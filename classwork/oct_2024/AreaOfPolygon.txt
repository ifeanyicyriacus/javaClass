computer the area of a polygon
Step1:
1. collect length of one side
2. collect number of side

step2:
1. prompt the user to enter length of one side
2. collect the value
3. store value in lengthOfSide
4. prompt the user to enter the number of sides
5. collect the value
6. store the value in noOfSide
7. calculate (noOfSide * Math.pow(lengthOfSide, 2))/(4*Math.tan(Math.PI/noOfSide))
8. store value as areaOfPolygon
9. display the area as areaOfPolygon
