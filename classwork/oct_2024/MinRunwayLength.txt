finging the runway length of an airplane
step1:
1. collect the acceleration (a)
2. collect the take-off speed (v)
3. calculate the minimum run way length of the airplane
4. display the result

step2:
1. prompt the user to enter the acceleration (in metres/second^2)
2. collect the value
3. store value as acceleration
4. prompt the user to enter the take off speed (in metres/second)
5. collect the value
6. store value as velocity
7. calculate acceleration^2/(2 x velocity)
8. store value as minRunwayLength
9. display the minRunwayLength to user
