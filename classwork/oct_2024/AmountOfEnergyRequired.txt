Step1:
1. calculate the energy needed to heat water from initial temp to final temp
2. display the energy

step2:
1. prompt the user to enter the amount of water in Kg
2. collect the value
3.store value as weightOfWater
4. prompt the user to enter initial temperature (in celcius)
5. collect the value
6. store value as initTemp
7. prompt the user to enter final temperature (in celcius)
8. collect the value
9. store value as finalTemp
10. calculate weightOfWater * (finalTemp - initTemp) * 4184
11. store value as energy
12. display the required amount of energy (in joules)
