Java program to reverse an array of integer values
declare and initialise a variable with an an array initializer list

//that first shall be the last and the last first, a merry go round
calculate (int)((array length)/2)
store as halfLength
you need to perform a swap while (counter <= halfLength)
	[0]1st swap with last[array_length-0]
	[1]2nd swap with 2nd last[array_length-1]
	[2]3rd swap with 3rd last[array_length-2]
