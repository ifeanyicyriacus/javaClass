a = [5, 7, 0, 2, 4]
i dont need to get the sum of everything, because the highest removed will result to the lowest sum and the lowest removed will cause the largest sum.
therefore just find the highest and the lowast in the list

int[] result = new int[2];
highest = a[0]
result[0] = 0
lowest = a[0]
result[1] = 0

for index[1] to index < []length of input
	if highest < a[index]:
	    highest = numbers[index];
		result[0] = index
	if lowest >  a[index]:
        lowest = numbers[index];
		result[1] = index
return result
