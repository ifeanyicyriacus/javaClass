4.37 (Distance between two points)
collect for point1 its x and y coordinate
store as x1 and y1 respectively
collect for point2 its xand y coordinate
store as x2 and y2 respectively

if x1 == x2:
	it is pependicular to the y axis
if y1 == y2
	it is perpendicular to the x axis
if x1 == x2 && y1 == y2
	they are the same point
