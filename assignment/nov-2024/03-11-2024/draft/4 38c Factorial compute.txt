4.38c Factorial: compute the value of e^x

collect the number of term
store as noOfTerm
collect the value of x
store as x

result = 1

while noOfTerm > 0
	nFactorial = 1
	for int i = noOfTerm; i > 0; i -=1 .....
		nFactorial *= i
		
	result += (x^noOfTerm)/nFactorial
	noOfTerm -= 1
	
display result
