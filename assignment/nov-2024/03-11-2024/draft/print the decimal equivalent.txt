print the decimal equivalent of a binary number:
collect a binary number 
store as binaryNumber
BASE = 2
decimalNumber = 0
counter = 0
pluckA = 10; pluckB = 1;

do the following....
	calculate (binaryNumber % pluckA) / pluckB 
	store as digit
	calculate (digit * (BASE ^ counter))
	and add result to decimalNumber


	pluckA *= 10; pluckB = *=10
	counter += 1
.....while((binaryNumber /pluckB) > 0)

display decimalNumber
