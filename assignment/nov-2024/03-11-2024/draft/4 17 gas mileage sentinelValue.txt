sentinelValue = -1
collect miles driven and gallon used (integers)
totalMiles = miles
totalGallonsUsed = gallonUsed
display the (totalMiles/totalGallonsUsed) for this trip

while(miles != sentinelValue)
	collect another miles driven and gallon used (integers)
	display the miles/gallon for each trip
	totalMiles += miles
	totalGallonsUsed += gallonUsed
	
print the combined miles/gallon of all trip combined
