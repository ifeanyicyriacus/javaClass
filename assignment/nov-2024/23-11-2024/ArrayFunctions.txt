question 1
1. to return the largest element
collect array
create a function to collect array:
	make first element the largest
	compare the the remaining element to the largest
		if an element is larger let largest hold its value
	return the largest
	
2. to reverse a list
swap beginning and the end until you get to the middle then stop
length is (array.length-1)
the middle is array.length // 2
the beginning is 0
do until you get to middle
temp = a[index]
a[index] = a[end]
a[end] = temp
increase index
reduce length

3. to check wether element occur in a list
collect list
collect element to search for
loop through to elements in list
	if element is found, immediately return true
if loops finishes return false

4. print the elemrnt on odd position on a list
collect list
create an empty arraylist loop through the list
	if element position is odd append it to the result arrayList
convert array list to array
return result

5. function to return the element on even position
collect list
create an emptyarraylist then loop through list
	if element position is even append it to the result arraylist
convert array list to array
return result

6. function to return the running total of the a list
	function receives the list as argument
	total variable is initializes to 0
	for each number in the array
		add it to the total
	return the total
#####in python use recursion

7. function to test wether a string is a palidrome
just like the reverse function
here
a. split the string using the split function
b. store as stringArray
c. get the length of the string array
d. get the middle by dividing the length by 2
e. compare 1 and last for equality
	if ever comapricm ks false return false
f. if it finishes return true

8. function to sum a list of number using for, while and do..while loop

9.function that concatinate two lists asuming there are both integer list
sum the length of both array atore in length
get the length of the first, store in length1
create a new array that is a copy of the first array and with expty spaces to exactly contain the 2nd array
loop through the 2nd array:
	add array2[index] to the new array at index[length1]
	increment length by 1
return newArray

10. function that combines two list by alternatingly taking elements:
array1 & array2
totalLength = length1 + length2
create new array of length {totalLength} called newArray
if length1 > length2 {let maxLength = length1}
	else {let maxLenght = length2}
loop through the length of the array with max length:
	count = 0;
	for (int index=0; index < maxLenght; index += 1){
		if (index < length1){
		newArray[count++] = array1[index]}
		if (index < length2){
		newArray[count++] = array2[index]}
	}
	return newArray

11. Write a function that takes a number and returns a list of its digits. So for 2342 it should return

accept the number
get the length of the number by checking the length of the string
create a list of lenth{length of string}
set crop1=10, crop2=1
loop length of string number of times from length to one:
	digit = calculate number%crop1/crop2
	list[index] = digit
	increment crop1 and crop2 by multiplying them by 10
return list
