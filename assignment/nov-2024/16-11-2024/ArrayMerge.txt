program to merge two sorted list into a single sorted array
assuming that the length of both are not known

collect firstArray store as array1
collect secondArray store as array2
get array1 length, store as array1Length
get array2 length, store as array2Length
totalLength = array1Length + array2Length

create a dynamic arraylist to add and resize as needed
store as combinedArray

for(int index = 0; index <totalLength; index += 1):
	if(index < array1Length):
		combinedArray.add(array1[index]);
	else:
		combinedArray.add(array2[index - array1Length]);

trim the array incase it is over size
return the combined array to user


import java.util.ArrayList;
ArrayList<String> items = new ArrayList<String>();
items.add("red");
itemstrimToSize();
