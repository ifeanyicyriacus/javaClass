Have a temp frequencyCounter 
Keep record of previous element

Outside the loop set frequencyCounter 

//How to manage the first element
When index ==0
     Set currentElement as previousElement 
     Continue
     Set counter=1
If previous element==current element
      Increment counter
Else
      NewArraylist.add({previous Element, counter})
      Set counter =1
      Set previousElement = currentElement
after the loop
	NewArraylist.add({previous Element, counter})
	to account for the last element
