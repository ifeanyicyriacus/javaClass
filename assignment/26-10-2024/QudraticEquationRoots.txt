Java program to solve quadratic equation
step1:
1. prompt user to enter the a, b, c values from the user
2. collect and store as a, b, c
3. calculate b^2 -4ac
4. store as discriminant
5. if a = 0 :
	a. display no roots
   else if discriminant > 0:
    a. calculate (b + discriminant) / 2 * a, store as root1
    b. calculate (b - discriminant) / 2 * a, store as root2
	c. display "The roots are {root1} and {root2}"
   else if discriminant == 0:
    a. calculate (b + discriminant) / 2 * a, store as root
    b. display "The root is {root}"
   else:
    a. calculate 1.0/(2 * a), store as imaginaryUnit
    b. calculate -b / 2 * a, store as realRoot
    c. display "The roots are {realRoot}+{imaginaryUnit}i and {realRoot}-{imaginaryUnit}i"
