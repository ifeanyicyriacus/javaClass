2.32: Negative, positive and zero value
step1:
1. collect five numbers from user
2. determine the number of +ve, -ve and zero (0) values
3. print their count

step2:
1. prompt the user to enter the numbers
2. collect the numbers
3. store as num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
4. store the count of +ve value as positivesCount
5. store the count of -ve value as negativesCount
6. store the count of zero (0) value as zerosCount
7. if num1 > 0, increase positivesCount by 1
8. else if num1 < 0, increase negativesCount by 1
9. else, increase zerosCount by 1
10. if num2 > 0, increase positivesCount by 1
11. else if num2 < 0, increase negativesCount by 1
12. else, increase zerosCount by 1
13. if num3 > 0, increase positivesCount by 1
14. else if num3 < 0, increase negativesCount by 1
15. else, increase zerosCount by 1
16. if num4 > 0, increase positivesCount by 1
17. else if num4 < 0, increase negativesCount by 1
18. else, increase zerosCount by 1
19. if num5 > 0, increase positivesCount by 1
20. else if num5 < 0, increase negativesCount by 1
21. else, increase zerosCount by 1
22. print the number of [positivesCount, negativesCount, zerosCount]
