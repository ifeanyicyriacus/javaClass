Create a class HugeInteger 
	which uses a 40-element array of digits to store integers 40 digits large
	
	
	
Provide methods: 
	parse: receive a String, extract each digit using method charAt and place the integer equivalent of each digit into the integer array.
		-parse should handle negative number too
	toString: 
		- it might handle out of bound, same with setNumber
		- find the first occurance of 1-9
			+ for each element check to see if reater than 0 if yes
			+ set as substring start index
			+ break 
		- substring(form first occurance to end)
	add
		add should handle negative number, perhaps call the substract function
	subtract.
		substract should handle negative number pehaps call add
	
For comparing HugeInteger objects, provide the following methods: 
	isEqualTo
	isNotEqualTo
	isGreaterThan:
		if isEqual return false
		if A is -ve and B +ve false:
			else if A is +ve and B is -ve true
			else if polarity is thesame:
				if length A is greater than B true else false
				if length is the same:
					start looping through digit to compare their digits begining from the first index (40 - length) or go through all
						if ever A[] < B[] return false
					if loop finishes return true
					
	isLessThan
	isGreaterThanOrEqualTo
	isLessThanOrEqualTo

Provide a predicate method
	isZero

provide methods: (i recommend you overload them to work on both int and HugeInteger)
	multiply
	divide
	remainder
