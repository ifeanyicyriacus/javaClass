Create a class HugeInteger 
	which uses a 40-element array of digits to store integers 40 digits large
	
	
	
Provide methods: 
	parse: receive a String, extract each digit using method charAt and place the integer equivalent of each digit into the integer array.
	toString: 
		- it might handle out of bound, same with setNumber
		- find the first occurance of 1-9
			+ for each element check to see if reater than 0 if yes
			+ set as substring start index
			+ break 
		- substring(form first occurance to end)
	add
	subtract.
	
For comparing HugeInteger objects, provide the following methods: 
	isEqualTo
	isNotEqualTo
	isGreaterThan
	isLessThan
	isGreaterThanOrEqualTo
	isLessThanOrEqualTo

Provide a predicate method
	isZero

provide methods: (i recommend you overload them to work on both int and HugeInteger)
	multiply
	divide
	remainder
