step1:
1. collect two numbers (number1, number2) via keyboard
2. calculate number1 raised to the power of number2
3. display the result to the user

step2:
1. prompt the user to enter 1st number
2. store as base
3. prompt the user to enter 2nd number
4. store as exponent
5. result = base
6. counter = 2
7. if exponent is equal to zero, result = 1
   else,
   		while counter is less than or equal to exponent do...:
	   		a. result = result x base
	   		b. increase counter by 1

8. if exponent is less than zero, result = 1/result
9. display result
